# maybe - Go Optional, Nullable Types and Functional Utilities

`maybe` is a Go package providing type-safe optional values and functional
programming utilities using Go generics. It helps eliminate nil pointer panics
and provides a more expressive way to handle optional values in Go. The package
brings modern constructs like `Option[T]` and `Nullable[T]` to Go with strong
database and JSON integration, along with functional utilities for cleaner data
transformation.
